**Author:** *Wing Fung Wu*

## Lauguage
- python

## Run the program

```shell
python3 schedSim.py <job-file.txt> -p <ALGORITHM> -q <QUANTUM>
```

## Questions

### Q1: For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
<p> A1: </p>

### Q2: For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
<p> A2: </p>

### Q3: What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
<p> A3: </p>

### Q4: What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
<p> A4: </p>
