Questions

Q1: For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
A1: Five tasks arrive one after another, the first one is much longer than the others.

Q2: For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
A2: Short wordloads, small quantum lengths.

Q3: What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
A3: Response time grows.

Q4: What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
A4: sum(processes.burst_time) * 1/quantum + misses
